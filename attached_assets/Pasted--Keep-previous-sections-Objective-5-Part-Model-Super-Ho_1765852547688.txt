🔗 HOOK SELECTION SUBSTAGES (MULTI-MODAL ARCHITECTURE)
The "Hook" phase is now split into three distinct, sequential substages. You must process inputs and generate ranked options for *each* specific modality.

### SUBSTAGE 1: TEXT HOOKS (On-Screen & Captions)
**Focus:** The very first text the user reads (Thumbnails, On-Screen Text/Captions, Title Cards).
**Input Context:** User's Niche, Topic, Target Audience.
**Output Requirement:** Generate 6 ranked Text Hook options.
* **Structure:** Short, punchy, high-contrast text.
* **Ranking Criteria:** Readability (scan-speed), Curiosity Gap, Relevance to User Input.

### SUBSTAGE 2: VERBAL HOOKS (Script Openers)
**Focus:** The first sentence spoken or audio cue.
**Input Context:** User's Niche, Brand Tone (Experimenter/Gamifier/Educator), Specific Topic.
**Output Requirement:** Generate 6 ranked Verbal Hook options.
* **Structure:** Pattern interrupts, direct questions, "Super Hook" methodology (Effort, Failure, Credibility).
* **Ranking Criteria:** Emotional engagement, alignment with the "Super Hook" strategy, database efficacy scores.

### SUBSTAGE 3: VISUAL HOOKS (Scene & Setting)
**Focus:** The visual composition, camera angle, and environment.
**Input Context:** User Answers to: "Shooting Location" (e.g., Home Office, Gym, Outdoors), "Lighting Vibe", "Available Props".
**Output Requirement:** Generate 6 ranked Visual Hook options.
**CRITICAL:** Each Visual Hook option must provide TWO execution paths:
    1.  **FIY (Film It Yourself):** Directorial instructions (Angle, Lighting, Action).
    2.  **GenAI Prompt (Lyra-Optimized):** A detailed, highly descriptive prompt suitable for Midjourney/DALL-E to generate a B-Roll background or visual overlay.

### RANKING & DATABASE LOGIC (APPLIES TO ALL STAGES)
For every substage:
1.  **Database Lookup:** Query the `hook_database.tsv` filtering by the specific substage type (Text/Verbal/Visual).
2.  **Score & Rank:** Assign a rank (1-6) based on:
    * Database Efficacy Score (Probability of conversion).
    * Semantic fit with user input.
    * Psychological Trigger strength.
3.  **Recommendation:** Flag the #1 option as `isRecommended: true`.

### FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON STRUCTURE)
Ensure the JSON response is structured to support the 3-step UI flow:
