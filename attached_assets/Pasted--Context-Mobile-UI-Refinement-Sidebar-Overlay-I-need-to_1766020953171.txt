# Context: Mobile UI Refinement - Sidebar Overlay
I need to fix the responsive behavior of the new Sidebar component on mobile devices. Currently, opening the sidebar "pushes" and compresses the chat interface.

# Objective
Refactor the Sidebar to mimic the Google Gemini mobile UX. On mobile screens, the sidebar must behave as an **Overlay (Drawer)**, not a structural element that consumes width.

# Specific Requirements

## 1. CSS/Layout Changes (Tailwind/React)
* **Positioning:** Change the Sidebar's mobile styling from `relative` to `fixed` (top-0, left-0, h-full).
* **Z-Index:** Ensure the Sidebar has a high z-index (e.g., `z-50`) so it floats above the chat interface.
* **Transition:** Add a smooth transform transition (`translate-x`) so it slides in from the left rather than just appearing.

## 2. The "Backdrop" Mechanism (Click-to-Close)
* When the sidebar is OPEN on mobile, render a semi-transparent black overlay (backdrop) that covers the rest of the screen (the chat area).
* **Style:** `fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 z-40`.
* **Logic:**
    * If the user clicks on this Backdrop, the sidebar should close (`setIsOpen(false)`).
    * If the user clicks *inside* the Sidebar (e.g., clicking a past chat), the sidebar should remain open (unless the action triggers a navigation that implies closing, but for now, focus on the backdrop logic).

## 3. Responsive Breakpoints
* **Mobile (< md):** Use the Overlay/Fixed behavior described above.
* **Desktop (>= md):** (Optional) You can keep the existing "Push" behavior or sidebar visibility if preferred, but strictly ensure the Mobile view uses the Overlay approach.

# Implementation Plan
Please provide the updated React code for the `Sidebar` component and the `Layout` wrapper. Focus on:
1.  Adding the Backdrop `div` with the `onClick` handler.
2.  Updating the Sidebar's classes to support `fixed` positioning on mobile.
3.  Ensuring the main Chat interface remains full-width and uncompressed behind the overlay.
